## License Keys

QShield uses offline HMAC-based license validation. License keys are generated by Homatch AI and validated locally — no phone-home required.

### Key Format
```
QS-{TIER}-{PAYLOAD}-{SIGNATURE}
```

Example: `QS-PRO-abc123def456-a1b2c3d4e5f6`

### Activation
1. Purchase a license at https://qshield.app/pricing
2. Receive license key via email
3. Open QShield Desktop > Settings > License
4. Enter license key > Activate

### Offline Validation
License keys are validated using HMAC-SHA256 without contacting any server. The key encodes:
- Tier (Free/Pro/Business/Enterprise)
- Expiry date
- Device limit
- Cryptographic signature

This means QShield works fully offline after activation.

## Trial Period
New installations get a 14-day trial of Pro features. After the trial, unactivated installations revert to Free tier.

## Enterprise Licensing
Contact sales@qshield.app for:
- Volume licensing (10+ seats)
- Custom integrations
- On-premise gateway deployment
- Dedicated support and SLA
